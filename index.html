        <p>Come a little bit closer, hear what I have to say</p>
        <p>Just like children sleepin' we could dream this night away</p>
        <p>But there's a full moon risin', let's go dancin' in the light</p>
        <p>We know where the music's playin', let's go out and feel the night</p>
        <br>
        <p>Because I'm still in love with you, I want to see you dance again</p>
        <p>Because I'm still in love with you, on this harvest moon</p>
        <br>
        <p>When we were strangers, I watched you from afar</p>
        <p>When we were lovers, I loved you with all my heart</p>       
        <p>But now it's gettin' late, and the moon is climbin' high</p>
        <p>I want to celebrate, see it shinin' in your eye</p>  
        <br>
        <p>Because I'm still in love with you, I want to see you dance again</p>
        <p>Because I'm still in love with you, on this harvest moon</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now it's gettin' late, and the moon is climbin' high</p>
        <p>I want to celebrate, see it shinin' in your eye</p>  
        <p>Because I'm still in love with you, I want to see you dance again</p>
        <p>Because I'm still in love with you, on this harvest moon</p>
